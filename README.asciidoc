[NOTE]
Since this is the first check-in, not much info has been added yet.
But he will do soon.

== Summary

syslog_ninja is a plsql implementation to integrate the database directly with syslog servers. This way we can write errors directly to syslog
, for other monitoring applications to read (BMC, Tivoli, etc.). The less you have to configure in these monitoring tools the better.

== Pre-requisites

Any schema installing this package needs the following oracle privileges:

* create procedure
* execute on utl_tcp

Aside from this, the schema needs to be part of a network ACL that allows resolve and connect, to the host
running the syslog server (look at acl.sql for an example of this).
